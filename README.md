# friend-finder

Friend finder is a survey that takes in your name, a photo, and 10 questions.

The data taken from the client side, passed to the api endpoing `/api/friends`, and a match is made to another user who has the closest score to your total score you just submitted. That user will be presented to you in a modal popup with their name and photo.
